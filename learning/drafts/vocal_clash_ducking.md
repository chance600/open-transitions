# DRAFT: vocal_clash_ducking

Status: DRAFT — not a registry entry. Requires human review before
implementation, demo, or merge.

- Source: rustlarpdj (https://github.com/T-Perm/RustLarpDJ)
- License note: license unconfirmed - learn-from only, no code reuse
- Summary: Lyric vocal windows for both tracks mapped onto wall-clock overlap via tempo anchors, with overlapping windows triggering a -9 dB mid-EQ duck on the outgoing deck starting 1 beat early; transfers as a vocal guard that ducks rather than blocks a blend.

- Use when: (fill in, grounded in evidence, not invented)

## Demo + verification checklist (all must pass before merge)

- [ ] Implementation added as an engine function + META entry
- [ ] Demo rendered and listed in demos/out/verification.json
      with render_ok, silence_ok, and headroom_ok all true
- [ ] Technique named in a shipped render and heard by a human
- [ ] Promotion gate passed (see learning/verdicts.py):
      human PASS/heart verdict required; machine metrics never promote
